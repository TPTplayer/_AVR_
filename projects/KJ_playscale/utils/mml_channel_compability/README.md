Usage: Enter the name of the file to be converted and the name of the result file as command line arguments.  
Result: A new file is created that removes things that the tiny mml parser library does not recognize.  
  
Note: It is not recommended to use the converted file as it is. Open the file with a text editor and copy the mml string for each channel and paste it where appropriate.
